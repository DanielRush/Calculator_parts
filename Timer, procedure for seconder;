{Dear Kosta and Daniel we need to debug and test the following code}
{Already added into github repository}
Program Timer;
Uses
crt;
var
s, m, h: integer;
const
e=':';
Label
Label1;
Begin
m:=0;
s:=0;
h:=0;
If s=0
then
begin
Label1:
repeat
delay(1000);
s:=s+1;
clrscr;
writeln(s,e,m,e,h);
until s=59;
s:=0;
m:=m+1;
repeat
goto Label1;
until m=59;
s:=0;
m:=0;
h:=h+1;
repeat
goto Label1;
until h=23
end
else
If keypressed then{no idea why this method is ignored probably we need to add or operator in the string of untilS? idea is that we need some additional procedure here};
halt(0);
end.
